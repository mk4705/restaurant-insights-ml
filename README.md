# Restaurant Insights - Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains three internship-level machine learning tasks based on restaurant data analysis. Each task demonstrates the use of different ML techniques for classification, regression, and recommendation.

## Tasks Overview
### 1.Cuisine Classification
- **Goal**: Predict the cuisine category of a restaurant based on its features.
- **ML Type**: Classification
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Highlights**: Label encoding, train-test split, model accuracy evaluation

### 2.Aggregate Rating Prediction
- **Goal**: Predict the average user rating of a restaurant using its attributes.
- **ML Type**: Regression
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Linear Regression, Random Forest
- **Highlights**: Feature scaling, missing value treatment, evaluation using RMSE and RÂ²

### 3.Restaurant Recommendation System
- **Goal**: Recommend similar restaurants based on user preferences and features.
- **ML Type**: Recommendation System (Content-based or Hybrid)
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Cosine Similarity
- **Highlights**: Text vectorization, similarity scoring, top-N recommendations
